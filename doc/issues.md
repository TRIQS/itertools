Please report all problems and bugs directly at the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/TRIQS/itertools/issues).
In order to make it easier for us to solve the issue please follow these guidelines:

1. In all cases specify which version of the application you are using. You can
   find the version number in the file `CMakeLists.txt` at the root of the
   application sources.

2. If you have a problem during the installation, give us information about
   your operating system and the compiler you are using. Include the outputs of
   the `cmake` and `make` commands as well as the `CMakeCache.txt` file
   which is in the build directory. Please include these outputs in a
   [gist](http://gist.github.com/>) file referenced in the issue.

3. If you are experiencing a problem during the execution of the application, provide
   a script which allows to quickly reproduce the problem.

Thanks!
